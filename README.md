# Fancy Homepage: Cleaner, Faster, Better.
A wonderful, clean, minimal browser homepage applicable to all browsers!

I made this for myself cause i'm tired of being spammed porn, news, and politics.

Homepages ALWAYS do this, news and all, it's so annoying!

# How to?

Now the proccess will vary from browser to browser on how to set this as a primary homepage.

And there are mainly 2 methods:

## METHOD 1: LINK:

### On Google Chrome/most Chrome based browsers:

1: Go to the browser settings (however you do it).

2: Find "On Startup" or "Homepage" (for me on Vivaldi it's on Tabs/New Tab Page).

3: Find the "Specific Page" or "Open Specific URL" field.

4: Enter THIS URL into the field: https://smilertron.github.io/fancy-homepage.github-io/

5: Save changes and, voila!

### On Firefox/firefox based browsers:

1: Go to the browser settings (however you do it).

2: Find "Homepage And New Windows" or something along those lines.

3: Find the Startpage area and select Custom URL

4: Enter THIS URL into the field: https://smilertron.github.io/fancy-homepage.github-io/

5: Save changes and, voila, again!

### On Safari:

1: Open Safari and navigate on the top bar to Safari > Settiings.

2: In the general tab, find "Homepage", "New Tabs Open With", and "New Windows Open With"

3: Set "New Tabs Open With" and "New Windows Open With" to Homepage to ensure Fancy Homepage ALWAYS opens!

4: Set the Homepage URL to this: https://smilertron.github.io/fancy-homepage.github-io/

5: Save changes and, once again, voila!



## METHOD 2: HTML:

### All browsers:

1: Repeat ALL the steps for your browser until you are on Step 4.

2: Download the Index.html from source, and copy the filepath it is in.

3: Paste that filepath into the URL field instead of the URL.

4: For the LAST time, voila!



***Now no method is better than the other, although theoretically method 2 may be slightly faster in load times***


# FINAL NOTES:

This was made for me and me first, so i designed it to work with Vivaldi.

It'll work 100% for any Chrome-Based browser.

It'll work 100% for any Firefox-Based browser.

I can't test Safari though (cause im a windows user), so it MAY work, i'll take feedback as to if it does, and fix it if it doesn't!

Thanks for your support!
